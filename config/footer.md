## ðŸ“¬ Contributing

Built or discovered a new streamlit app? Adding it to this list is dead simple: You just 
have to add a few lines of YAML code to [projects.yaml](projects.yaml) and then 
re-generate the README.md file. Screenshots, Github stars, and ranking work completely 
automatic. A detailed guide will follow soon, for now please have a look 
[here](https://github.com/best-of-lists/best-of-generator#projects) 
and at [projects.yaml](projects.yaml) itself.
